# Application Description

The **HealthAI Web Application** allows **doctors** to view their **patients** and all of their details with ease using our custom designed interface. **Doctors** will see their **patients** displayed in a *list* format, and from there can select the desired **patient** to view their info in more detail.

## Logging In/Signing Up

**Doctors** must first sign up, requiring them to confirm information such as their **GP ID**, **Office Address** and **Office Telephone** to ensure only registered **doctors** can access this material.

Once a **doctor** has successfully registered with our application, they can login by using the email and password they provided, or alternatively by using the "***Continue With Google***" option, assuming their login details are registered with Chrome.

### Security

**Doctors** ***MUST*** provide details such as **GP ID**, **Office Address** and **Office Telephone** to confirm they are a registered practitioner. Otherwise, a user cannot be created and use of our applicatin will not be granted. 

Our application also ensures that **doctors** have access to ***only*** their own **patients**, preventing **doctors** from viewing the **patients** of other **doctors**
