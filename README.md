# Application Description

The **HealthAI Web Application** allows **doctors** to view their **patients** and all of their details with ease using our custom designed interface. **Doctors** will see their **patients** displayed in a *list* format, and from there can select the desired **patient** to view their info in more detail.

## Logging In/Signing Up

**Doctors** must first sign up, requiring them to confirm information such as their **GP ID**, **Office Address** and **Office Telephone** to ensure only registered **doctors** can access this material.

Once a **doctor** has successfully registered with our application, they can login by using the email and password they provided.

## Creating New Patients

**Doctors** will create their own **patient**, inputting their patients details into the form found in the *add patient* tab of the website. This will also create a randomly generated password, which will then be emailed to the patient, as well as assign that **patient** to the **doctor** who created it. From there, the patient will log into the mobile app, where upon first login they will fill out a form to fill in the rest of the details required to use the service. 

### Security

**Doctors** ***MUST*** provide details such as **GP ID**, **Office Address** and **Office Telephone** to confirm they are a registered practitioner. Otherwise, a user cannot be created and use of our application will not be granted. 

Our application also ensures that **doctors** have access to ***only*** their own **patients**, preventing **doctors** from viewing the **patients** of other **doctors**
